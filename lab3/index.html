		<h1>Arlo Reilly</h1>
		<p>Welcome to Me! My name is Arlo Reilly and im a second year art major here in Surf City Santa Cruz. I love to splash around in the ocean and when its too windy I can be found wondering around on land, unfortunatley I have not explored the skys to much yet but you just wait, I'll get up there whether it be sky diving or in an UP esque fashion.(A seemless transition to my next topic, animated movies) Ratatouille is hands down the best film of all time and I know what your saying "yea maybe if you're only talkin animated." But if you are saying that right now you are quite mistaken. I am talking any genre, any film, Ratatouille wears the crown. I defintely have a love hate relationship with coding, becuase when its not going right for you that feeling really REALLY sucks, but when it starts working and the gears start clickin GOD DAMN does that feel great! Im also from LA and yesterday was my moms birthday, so shoutout to her because I love her and because she created me.</p>
